# SharePoint

Below you find the information about SharePoint to get this app working.
1. Create a SharePoint list.
  1. First use "memoryimages" as title and then rename the list to "Memory images".
2. Create a column of type "Single line of text". Call it "fafapp2miurl" and then rename it to "Url".
3. Create a column of type "Single line of text". Call it "fafapp2micategory" and then rename it to "Category".

You can use your own internal names of course but then you need to make some changes to the app too.
